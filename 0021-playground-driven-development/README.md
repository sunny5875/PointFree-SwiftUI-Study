> We use Swift playgrounds on this series as a tool to dive deep into functional programming concepts, but they can be so much more. Today we demonstrate a few tricks to allow you to use playgrounds for everyday development, allowing for a faster iteration cycle.

### Getting Started

* Clone repo
* `cd` into this directory
* Initialize submodule: `git submodule update --init`
* Open `ep0021.xcworkspace`
* Build `cmd+B`, or run `cmd+R` the "PointFree" app target
* Explore the app or run the playground
