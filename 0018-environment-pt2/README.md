> Let’s have some fun with the “environment” form of dependency injection we previously explored. We’re going to extract out a few more dependencies, strengthen our mocks, and use our Overture library to make manipulating the environment friendlier.

### Getting Started

* Clone repo
* `cd` into this directory
* Initialize submodule: `git submodule update --init`
* Open `Environment.xcworkspace`
* Build `cmd+B`
* Open and run the playground!
