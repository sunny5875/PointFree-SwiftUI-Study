> We will explore two more domain transformations in the Composable Architecture. One comes with the library: the ability to embed a smaller domain, optionally, in a larger domain. Another we will build from scratch: the ability to embed smaller domains in the cases of an enum!

For the enum section of the episode, see [this GitHub comparison](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/compare/912f3e6e5eb942e40fa650ca7cceaa49218d89d4...236e60bfd4058e1b624925054d9b463be0d6b602).
