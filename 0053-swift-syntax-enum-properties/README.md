> We've seen how "enum properties" help close the gap between the ergonomics of accessing data on structs and enums, but defining them by hand requires a _lot_ of boilerplate. This week we join forces with Apple's Swift Syntax library to generate this boilerplate automatically!

### Getting Started

* Clone repo
* `cd` into `EnumProperties`
* run `swift package generate-xcodeproj`
* Open the generated `EnumProperties.xcodeproj` file
* Build the package
* Open `EnumProperties.playground`
