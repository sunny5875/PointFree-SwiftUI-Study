> We begin to layer on behavior in our rewrite of Apple’s “Scrumdinger” demo application, starting with navigation. We will do some upfront work to model it in our application state, as concisely as possible, to avoid a whole class of bugs, unlock deep linking, and enable testability.

Scrumdinger sample code is available [here](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/getting-started-with-scrumdinger#Time-to-begin).
