> We wrap up our tour of [isowords](https://www.isowords.xyz) by showing off two powerful ways the iOS client and Swift server share code. Not only does the same code that routes server requests simultaneously power the API client, but we can write integration tests that exercise the full clientâ€“server lifecycle.

The isowords source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/pointfreeco/isowords/tree/c2793f4aacbbe5273062ab2a064bb743b74bf9de).
