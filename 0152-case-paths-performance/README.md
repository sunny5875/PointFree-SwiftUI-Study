> This week we improve the performance of another part of the Composable Architecture ecosystem: case paths! We will benchmark the reflection mechanism that powers case paths and speed things up with the help of a Swift runtime function.

For the section of the episode where we refactor the Case Paths, see [this GitHub pull request](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-case-paths/pull/35).
