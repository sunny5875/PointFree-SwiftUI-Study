 # The Many Faces of Zip: Part 1

 ## Exercises

 1.) In this episode we came across closures of the form `{ ($0, $1.0, $1.1) }` a few times in order to unpack a tuple of the form `(A, (B, C))` to `(A, B, C)`. Create a few overloaded functions named `unpack` to automate this.

 2.) Define `zip4`, `zip5`, `zip4(with:)` and `zip5(with:)` on arrays and optionals. Bonus: [learn](https://nshipster.com/swift-gyb/) how to use Apple's `gyb` tool to generate higher-arity overloads.

// TODO
/*:
 3.) Do you think `zip2` can be seen as a kind of associative infix operator? For example, is it true that `zip(xs, zip(ys, zs)) == zip(zip(xs, ys), zs)`? If it's not strictly true, can you define an equivalence between them?
 */
// TODO
/*:
 4.) Define `unzip2` on arrays, which does the opposite of `zip2: ([(A, B)]) -> ([A], [B])`. Can you think of any applications of this function?
 */
// TODO
/*:
 5.) It turns out, that unlike the `map` function, `zip2` is not uniquely defined. A single type can have multiple, completely different `zip2` functions. Can you find another `zip2` on arrays that is different from the one we defined? How does it differ from our `zip2` and how could it be useful?
 */
// TODO
/*:
 6.) Define `zip2` on the result type: `(Result<A, E>, Result<B, E>) -> Result<(A, B), E>`. Is there more than one possible implementation? Also define `zip3`, `zip2(with:)` and `zip3(with:)`.

 Is there anything that seems wrong or ‚Äúoff‚Äù about your implementation? If so, it
 will be improved in the next episode üòÉ.

/*:
 7.) In [previous](/episodes/ep14-contravariance) episodes we've considered the type that simply wraps a function, and let's define it as `struct Func<R, A> { let apply: (R) -> A }`. Show that this type supports a `zip2` function on the `A` type parameter. Also define `zip3`, `zip2(with:)` and `zip3(with:)`.
 */
// TODO
/*:
 8.) The nested type `[A]? = Optional<Array<A>>` is composed of two containers, each of which has their own `zip2` function. Can you define `zip2` on this nested container that somehow involves each of the `zip2`'s on the container types?
