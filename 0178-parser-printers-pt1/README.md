> We’ve spent many episodes discussing parsing, which turns nebulous blobs of data into well-structured data, but sometimes we need the “inverse” process to turn well-structured data back into nebulous data. This is called “printing” and can be useful for serialization, URL routing and more. This week we begin a journey to build a unified, composable framework for parsers and printers.
